Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me read the specific files to see the exact structure of the add and edit feature dialogs:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now I have a clear understanding of both dialogs. I need to:

1. In the **Add Feature Dialog** (lines 1342-1419): Move the Description field before the Category field
2. In the **Edit Feature Dialog** (lines 1452-1536): Move the Description field before the Category field

Let me make these edits:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now let me update the Edit Feature Dialog similarly:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Both dialogs have been updated. Now let me verify the changes are correct by reading the updated sections:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now let me verify the edit dialog changes:
🔧 Tool: Read
Both dialogs have been successfully updated. The changes are:

1. **Add New Feature Dialog**: 
   - Description field now comes first
   - Category field now comes second with label "Category (optional)"

2. **Edit Feature Dialog**:
   - Description field now comes first  
   - Category field now comes second with label "Category (optional)"

Now let me mark this feature as verified using the UpdateFeatureStatus tool:
