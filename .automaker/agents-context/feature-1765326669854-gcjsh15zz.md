Starting code implementation...

🔧 Tool: Glob
Let me look at the project structure more specifically:

Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me implement the feature:

1. Add a `defaultSkipTests` setting to the app store (persisted)
2. Add a toggle in the settings page
3. Update the "Add Feature" dialog to:
   - Default skipTests based on user preference
   - Show "Verification Steps" label instead of "Steps" when skipTests is enabled
4. Also update the edit dialog label

  "old_string": "  // Kanban Card Display Settings\n  kanbanCardDetailLevel: KanbanCardDetailLevel; // Level of detail shown on kanban cards\n}",
  "new_string": "  // Kanban Card Display Settings\n  kanbanCardDetailLevel: KanbanCardDetailLevel; // Level of detail shown on kanban cards\n\n  // Feature Default Settings\n  defaultSkipTests: boolean; // Default value for skip tests when creating new features\n}"
}

Input: {
  "file_path": "/Users/webdevcody/Workspace/automaker/app/src/store/app-store.ts",
  "old_string": "  maxConcurrency: 3, // Default to 3 concurrent agents\n  kanbanCardDetailLevel: \"standard\", // Default to standard detail level\n};",
  "new_string": "  maxConcurrency: 3, // Default to 3 concurrent agents\n  kanbanCardDetailLevel: \"standard\", // Default to standard detail level\n  defaultSkipTests: false, // Default to TDD mode (tests enabled)\n};"
}
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now I need to add `defaultSkipTests` to the persisted state:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me add the toggle in the settings page. I'll add a new section for Feature Defaults:
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: Edit
Now let me find where I can add the new section. Let me read more of the settings view to find where to add the feature defaults section:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now let me add the Feature Defaults section after the Kanban Card Display section:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me update the board-view.tsx to:
1. Use `defaultSkipTests` as the default value for new features
2. Change the label from "Steps" to "Verification Steps" when skipTests is enabled
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Edit
Now I need to update the newFeature state initialization to use defaultSkipTests. Since it's initialized with a static value, I need to use an effect to sync it when the dialog opens or when defaultSkipTests changes:
🔧 Tool: Read
I need to update the handleAddFeature to reset skipTests to the default value:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now I also need to make sure the initial state and when dialog opens uses the default. Let me add an effect that resets the form when the dialog opens:
🔧 Tool: Read
I need to add an effect to reset the skipTests when the dialog opens. Let me find a good place to add it:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now let me update the label from "Steps" to "Verification Steps" when skipTests is enabled. Let me find the Add Feature dialog:
🔧 Tool: Read
I'll now update the label to change dynamically based on skipTests. I also need to:
1. Change the "Steps" label to "Verification Steps" when skipTests is enabled
2. Only show the steps section when skipTests is enabled (based on the requirement "if it's enabled, show the steps to allow user to add manual testing steps")

Let me update the add feature dialog:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me find and update the Edit Feature dialog to also show "Verification Steps" when skipTests is enabled:
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me verify the implementation is correct by checking that everything compiles. Let me run a quick type check:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The errors are from an example file and API routes, not from the files I modified. The core application code I changed compiles correctly. Let me verify specifically that the files I modified don't have errors:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The errors are in a different file (analysis-view.tsx) that imports from the store but has missing types - not related to my changes. The store, board-view, and settings-view themselves have no type errors.

Let me now mark the feature as verified using the UpdateFeatureStatus tool:
🔧 Tool: mcp__automaker-tools__UpdateFeatureStatus
Let me check if the feature exists in the feature list:
🔧 Tool: Bash

🔧 Tool: Read
The feature list is empty. This could be because the feature is being tracked elsewhere or the file was cleared. Let me clear my todo list and provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Feature Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the feature to remember the user's choice for skip testing and added a settings toggle. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### Files Modified:

1. **`app/src/store/app-store.ts`**
   - Added `defaultSkipTests: boolean` to the AppState interface
   - Added `setDefaultSkipTests: (skip: boolean) => void` action
   - Set initial state to `false` (TDD mode by default)
   - Added `defaultSkipTests` to the persisted state so it's remembered across sessions

2. **`app/src/components/views/settings-view.tsx`**
   - Added `FlaskConical` icon import and `Checkbox` component import
   - Added `defaultSkipTests` and `setDefaultSkipTests` from the store
   - Added a new "Feature Defaults" section with a toggle for "Skip automated testing by default"
   - The toggle is displayed with helpful description text

3. **`app/src/components/views/board-view.tsx`**
   - Added `defaultSkipTests` from the store
   - Added an effect to sync `skipTests` default when the Add Feature dialog opens
   - **Add Feature Dialog**: 
     - Moved the skip tests checkbox above the steps section
     - Steps section now only shows when `skipTests` is enabled
     - Changed label from "Steps" to "Verification Steps"
     - Changed button from "Add Step" to "Add Verification Step"
     - Changed placeholder from "Step X" to "Verification step X"
   - **Edit Feature Dialog**:
     - Applied the same changes - steps only show when `skipTests` is enabled
     - Changed label to "Verification Steps" and button to "Add Verification Step"
   - Reset form uses `defaultSkipTests` value after adding a feature

### Behavior:
- Users can set their default preference in Settings → Feature Defaults
- When creating a new feature, the "Skip automated testing" checkbox will be pre-checked based on their preference
- When skip tests is enabled, the "Verification Steps" input section appears, allowing users to add manual testing/verification steps
- The setting persists across browser sessions via localStorage

**Note:** The feature could not be marked as verified via the UpdateFeatureStatus tool because the feature list appears to be empty. Since this is a `skipTests` feature, the user should manually review and commit the changes.✅ Verifying implementation for: remember the users choice for skip testing and add a setting toggle in settings page to let them change their default when making new tasks.  if it's enabled, show the steps to allow user to add manual testing steps.  change label from steps to Verification Steps
